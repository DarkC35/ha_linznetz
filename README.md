_Component to integrate with [ha_linznetz][ha_linznetz]._

**This component will set up the following platforms.**

Platform | Description
-- | --
`sensor` | Placeholder to import statistics by the service.

## Installation

### Supported Versions

The current code was adapted and tested with the following required versions. The integration might work on newer versions, however internal breaking changes introduced by Home-Assistant could break the integration. Please update with caution and open an issue if anything breaks. As a workaround, you can bulk import all your missing reports manually as soon as a fix for this integration is available.

Component | Min. Required Version
-|-
Home-Assistant | 2022.12.0
HACS | 1.28.4

### HACS (Custom Repository)

1. Navigate to `HACS` on your Home-Assistant dashboard.
2. Select `Integrations`.
3. Click on the menu in the top right corner and choose `Custom Repositories`.
4. Insert `https://github.com/DarkC35/ha_linznetz` for repository and select category `integration`.
5. Search for `LINZ NETZ` in the integration tab.
6. Click on the integration and install it with the button on the bottom right corner.
7. Restart Home-Assistant as prompted.
8. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "LINZ NETZ".


### Manual

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `linznetz`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/linznetz/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant.
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "LINZ NETZ".

Using your HA configuration directory (folder) as a starting point you should now also have this:

```text
custom_components/linznetz/translations/en.json
custom_components/linznetz/__init__.py
custom_components/linznetz/config_flow.py
custom_components/linznetz/const.py
custom_components/linznetz/manifest.json
custom_components/linznetz/sensor.py
custom_components/linznetz/services.yaml
```

## Configurations with the UI

**To use this integration you need a free account at https://www.linznetz.at and enable the quarter-hour(QH) analysis ("Viertelstundenauswertung"). Then it will take 1-2 days until your SmartMeter transfers the QH data to LINZ NETZ.** Please make sure you have a LINZ NETZ account since *LINZ AG Plus24* does not support QH E-Mail reports! (You can have both accounts if you want to.) You can check on the LINZ NETZ services page > "Verbrauchsdateninformation"/"Verbr채uche anzeigen" if your SmartMeter supports QH analysis and if your data is already transmitted to LINZ NETZ.

During the configuration insert the 33 characters long "meter point number" ("Z채hlerpunktnummer") you can find on https://www.linznetz.at > "Meine Verbr채uche" > "Verbr채uche anzeigen". This number is used as the unique ID. If you don't want to use your real number (e.g. for testing) just use `AT0000000000000000000000000000000` but please make sure you need another number if you need a second instance of this integration! The second configuration value `name` is optional, you can use it to identify different SmartMeters, the default name is "SmartMeter".

This will create a `sensor.smartmeter_energy` entity which you can use to import the QH reports to. To import your QH reports use the `linznetz.import_report` service.

After the import you can use the `sensor.smartmeter_energy` entity on the energy dashboard as a "grid consumption".

### TODOs
* Describe `linznetz.import_report` service.
* Add tests (see [#10](https://github.com/DarkC35/ha_linznetz/issues/10)).
* Add screenshots.

## Troubleshooting

Although this integration provides some logic to re-calculate the energy value when missing values are added afterwards (and not chronologically) it may happen that the values are corrupted at some point. The easiest way to fix this is to export a new bulk QH report from LINZ NETZ and import this report with the service to update all the values.

## Example automation for daily inserts

This example uses [emcniece/ha_imap_attachment](https://github.com/emcniece/ha_imap_attachment/) to download the attachments. You can install this component manually or as an HACS custom repository.

0. Optional: Before setting up the daily automation you can bulk import all your available previous QH values. Download them from linznetz.at as a csv file, copy this file to your HA installation and call the `linznetz.import_report` service from the HA developer tools page. This integrations tries to re-calculate and update the statistics when missing values are inserted afterwards but it's safer to insert them chronologically.
1. Install `ha_imap_attachment` and follow the steps to create a new folder for the attachments on your HA installation (we use `/config/attachments` here).
2. Lookup the IMAP configurations for your mail provider (example below uses Outlook). For Gmail you will have to set an App Password on your Google account and enable Multi-Factor Authentication (see [core IMAP docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/imap/#gmail-with-app-password)).
3. Optional: Login to your mail provider and create a new folder for the LINZ NETZ reports, e.g. `VDI`. If you don't want to use a new folder you have to use the folder `INBOX` in your configuration but it will be difficult to filter this way.
4. **IMPORTANT**: Since the reports are sent with SMIME encryption `ha_imap_attachment` downloads the encrypted mail instead of the attachments. To solve this problem you have to configure some rules for your inbox as a workaround: The easiest way is to forward the daily reports to yourself (or another mail address), this will remove the encryption (tested with Outlook.com). Example rules:
```
1. Mails with titles containing "Tagesbericht Viertelstundenverbrauch" from "vdi@linznetz.at" forward to <my mail address> and delete original mail.
2. Mails with titles containing "Tagesbericht Viertelstundenverbrauch" from <my mail address> move to folder "VDI".
```
5. Add the configs from the `configuration.yaml` example below to your configurations.
6. Restart Home-Assistant. You can test the configuration with forwarding a daily report to yourself. You should see a `sensor.linz_netz_attachments` (based on the sensor name in the configuration) entity with the path to a csv file now (this can take some minutes).
7. Create an automation like the `automation-example.yaml` below (as a file or with the UI; you can copy-paste this as-is).

### Some known problems

1. It can happen that the `ha_imap_attachment` loses connection to the IMAP server and does not re-connect in time when the daily report arrives. When this happens you can simply forward the e-mail report to yourself again and it should be downloaded and inserted. Beware that the IMAP integration may need some minutes until it detects the e-mail. Another way would be to download and import the report manually.
2. The same problem can happen if your HA instance is down (e.g. during an update or power outage) at this time. You can use the same fix mentioned above.
3. Although they claim to send you the report until 12:00 it can be later too. Normally you will get your report at the same time as the day before +/- 5 minutes.
4. It happens that LINZ NETZ does not send you a report on some days (I don't know why, maybe the SmartMeter does not send the data to them as you cannot see the values online either). Normally you will get two mails on the next day and this automation inserts them without a problem.
